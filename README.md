# Vivid Ciphers Website

You need to follow some rules to avoid chaos in code.  
Before you start, please take a look at:
* https://github.com/airbnb/css
* https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
* https://en.bem.info/methodology/

We need to work as a team, as one fullstack developer.  

Cheers!


## How to compile

1. Install recommended version of Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/  
2. Open your terminal and type ```npm install npm -g```  
3. Type 2 commands ```npm -v```,```node -v``` in your terminal to see that Node.js and npm was installed  
4. Go to your project dir. Open terminal and type ```npm install gulp```  
5. After Gulp was installed you need to install dependencies. Type ```npm install```
6. Now you can make some changes in different scss files. After work done, you should open the terminal in your project folder and type ```gulp compile```. This command will concatenate all scss files to one css inside ./production/css folder. Also, you may run ```gulp watch``` task. It will watch for a changes in your files and automatically run ```gulp sass``` task.  


## Proposed initial structure based on BEM  

It is NOT a final version of styles structure but hope it will help us to start our project.  
We need to cooperate to make it better. All suggestions are welcome!

Coming soon
